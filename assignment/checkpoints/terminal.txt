git version 2.15.0
# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
to see if any files were changed.
To see if you "add .", "git commit -m" or "git push origin main"  correctly. Will tell you numbers of commits I also believe.
# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
command adds all new or changed file to the git "staging area" for upload/push.
Just learned, "git add ." specifically stages/adds ALL new or changed file. 
Other options are "git add <path> and "git add -p". No idea how to use them but, but know there is a difference :parent
# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
command is "git push origin main"
was told origin main is important. Github does use other things different than "main", but we should use "main"
